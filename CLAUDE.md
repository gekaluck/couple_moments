# CLAUDE.md

## Purpose
Behavioral contract for automated contributors. This file defines how changes should be made in this repo.

## Rules
- Use `/docs/00_current/READ_THIS_FIRST.md` as the starting point for context.
- Keep documentation concise and factual.
- Do not invent architecture or product details; only move/refactor existing text.
- Record significant technical decisions in `/docs/00_current/DECISIONS.md` and/or `/docs/20_adrs/`.
- Keep rollout and testing items in `/docs/00_current/rollout_plan.md`.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes and clearly describe what moved/changed.
